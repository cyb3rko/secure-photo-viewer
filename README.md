## About this project

This app is here to protect you from you friends and enemies. Have you ever handed over your phone to show someone the latest meme? Or a cool pic you took? How often did they scroll too far and have seen something embarrassing in your gallery or image browser?

Now we have a solution: Select the pictures you want them to see in your gallery, press share and select the Secure Photo Viewer! Now they will only see what you want them to see. It works with any amount of photos or videos you share from you gallery! It's that easy to protect your privacy from nosy friends.
